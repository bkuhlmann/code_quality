## Setup

No setup is required other than what is mentioned in the *Requirements* section. If you would like
to use the project, locally, you can do so by opening a terminal window and executing the following
commands:

    git clone https://github.com/bkuhlmann/code_quality.git
    cd code_quality

Edit any of the `configurations/*` files as you see fit.

## Usage

This project is designed to be linked to your own projects. This can be done via one of the
following options:

Current Version (stable)

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkuhlmann/code_quality/3.0.0/configurations/<choose file>

Master Version (unstable)

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkuhlmann/code_quality/master/configurations/<choose file>

Here is a more concrete example using Rubocop. In your local `.rubocop.yml`, replace the contents
with the following:

    inherit_from:
      - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkuhlmann/code_quality/3.0.0/configurations/rubocop/ruby.yml
      - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkuhlmann/code_quality/3.0.0/configurations/rubocop/rails.yml
      - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkuhlmann/code_quality/3.0.0/configurations/rubocop/rspec.yml

Now you are configured to import from a global configuration. For further details, check out the
[Rubocop Documentation](http://bit.ly/2DeUr8p).
